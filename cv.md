## About me
I'm 16 years old. I graduated from the 9th grade of [Gymnasium № 2](https://gymn2.schools.by/) in Minsk. I have never done programming and now this is my first experience.
I am fond of doing computer work, for example, there: install some custom Windows(OS) or download something for a costomization. In general, do the maximum for the convenience of working at the computer

* **about my hobbys:**
I have a passion for working with video and audio, editing videos and and upload them to [YouTube](https://youtube.com/@thegregari9972?si=oFKapGtAOu6X9SGL), and assisting with the organization of events at school. I am skilled in operating a mixing board and troubleshooting computer issues.

* **My goals:**
I am interested in pursuing a career in the field of programming, and I would like to acquire more skills in this area. Programming — is a broad and interesting field that can contribute to both my personal growth and the overall development of society.
